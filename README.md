## JSON Approach

### Pros
1. Native PHP support - Laravel handles JSON parsing out of the box with json_decode()
2. Structured data - Perfect for complex, nested information (skills with proficiency levels, multiple job positions, etc.)
3. Easy validation - Can easily validate structure and required fields
4. API-ready - If you later want to expose CV data via API, JSON is ideal
5 .Database migration - Easy to later move to database storage

### Cons
1. Not human-friendly - Harder to read/edit manually
2. Syntax sensitive - One missing comma breaks everything
3. No rich formatting - Can't include bold, italics, or links directly in text
4. Verbose - More characters needed for structure

## Markdown Approach

### Pros
1. Human-readable - Easy to write and edit, even for non-developers
2. Rich formatting - Built-in support for bold, italics, links, lists
3. Version control friendly - Git diffs are meaningful and readable
4. Portable - Can be used across different systems
5 .GitHub integration - Renders nicely in repositories

### Cons
1. Parsing complexity - Need additional libraries (like parsedown)
2. Less structured - Harder to extract specific fields programmatically
3. Validation challenges - Difficult to enforce required sections
4. Limited data types - Everything is essentially text
5. Styling limitations - Can't easily add custom CSS classes to specific elements

## For a this project, I'd lean toward JSON because:
1. It aligns better with Laravel's strengths
2. Easier to implement caching and validation
3. More predictable for PDF generation
